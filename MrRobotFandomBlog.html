          Mr. Robot truly stands out and solidifies itself as one of the great
          works of television: its creative risk-taking, its genre-shifting, and
          its mastery of the medium. This show pushes the boundaries of
          television in a way I've never seen before, even among its
          contemporaries of the Golden Age.

          Elliot is mentally ill. He has dissociative identity disorder, which
          used to be known as multiple personality disorder. So parts of himself
          he's kind of fragmented into other people who he thinks he's talking
          to or seeing.
